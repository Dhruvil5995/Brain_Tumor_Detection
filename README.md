# Brain_Tumor_Detection

This is a project for detecting brain tumors using machine learning techniques. The project includes a dataset of brain MRI images labeled with tumor or non-tumor classes. It trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the images and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images. The images are categorized into two classes: "no tumor" and "tumor". The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model used for this project consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. It is implemented using the Keras framework.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.
