# Brain_Tumor_Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This is a project for detecting brain tumors using Deep Learning and machine-learning techniques. The project includes a dataset of brain MRI images labeled with tumor or non-tumor classes. It trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the images and make predictions. The model is implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Introduction

Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical imaging, and deep learning techniques have shown promising results in automating this process. This project aims to demonstrate the use of a CNN architecture for classifying brain MRI images as either containing tumors or being tumor-free.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images. The images are categorized into two classes: "no tumor" and "tumor". The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
